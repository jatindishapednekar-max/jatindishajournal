            <p>Can’t believe we met at HinduSoc in UNSW and now 3 months ho gaye, yaar. I made this tiny website for us - our chhota sa journal so every month we can drop a note for each other and one cute sa photo together, plus a full-on photo dump for all the masti. You tease me like full pagal sometimes, and your English is top-tier while mine is thoda theek - thaak but that’s why I keep saying be my “English teacher,” attendance 100%, homework = hugs 😂. We’ve had ups and downs, thoda drama, thode nakhre, but if you are there then everything is alright; you actually take care of me and I feel so khush and safe. Bas, this is our space to save the chhoti chhoti baatein and big yaadein, because I really, genuinely love you, and I’m grateful we’re partners-in-crime in life and jugaad both. 🫶</p>

            <p>Happy 3 Months Baeb [learnt from you]
Three months feels small when I say it out loud, but when I think about everything we’ve been through since the night we first met at hindu-soc ka latent night it feels like a lifetime. It is a beautiful but chaotic one which I would never trade for anything.
It still amazes me that after all our breakups and all the times we walked away and said “maybe this isn’t meant to work”, we somehow kept choosing each other. Even when it was hard, even when we were confused, even when we had no idea what we were doing, our hearts kept finding their way back. And I think that’s why I cherish us so much now. Because we’re not some perfect, easy story. We’re a story built on fighting for each other, again and again.
You call me your kaleshi aurat and your cute little fairy princess [ik i call myself that] and I call you my calm aadmi, my polar bear and my pookie. Our nick-names hold everything we are. The softness and the chaos. They hold the feeling that with you, I am safe. That I am seen. That I am loved in all the ways I never knew I needed.
Sometimes I think about how the night we met at Hindusoc was so random and unplanned. It makes me realise how easily our lives could have gone in different directions. How easily your eyes could have skipped my sight [deepthroating that subway like my rent depended on it] and we would have never met. But we did. We found each other in that noisy room not knowing where this path would take us and how much room in each other's heart we would eventually hold.
Our memories: garba, Diwali party, Govindas, Mad Mex, those long random walks, the late-night talks and cinema makeouts, have all become a little timestamp celebrating our relationship. However, what means the most to me isn't the ambience of the place or any grand moment. 
It is how I feel within your presence, in your arms. Safer than I’d feel in a bullet-proof vest. Held like you wanted to keep all the chaos in the world away from me. Wanted more than a drowning man wants a gasp of air. Like I finally belong to someone who belongs to me. Ik im dramatic. takes an exasperated sigh
You are my person. The one I want to marry. The father of the babies I already imagine in some silly soft corner of my heart. 
The one I want to grow old with, fight with, make up with, build a home with. The one I want to annoy and adore for the rest of my life. The only one I want to grow old with and don’t mind fighting and making up a hundred times as long as we both know that we are endgame. 
If this is the beginning, I can’t wait for the forever that follows.
I love you, my polar bear. More than every word I’ve written here. More than any letter can say.
Your penguin princess, always.</p>
